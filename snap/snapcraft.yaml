  spatialite-tools is a collection of open source Command Line Interface (CLI) tools supporting SpatiaLite.

    - spatialite: a complete CLI front-end, more or less equivalent to the well known sqlite3 front-end, but fully supporting SpatiaLite
    - spatialite_tool: a tool supporting import/export of Shapefiles and DBF-files
    - shp_doctor: a diagnostic tool to check anomalous shapefiles
    - exif_loader: an import tool for EXIF or EXIF-GPS (JPEG) pictures
    - spatialite_network: a tool creating a VirtualNetwork (supporting shortest path / routing SQL queries)
    - spatialite_gml: a tool importing GML files
    - spatialite_convert: a tool converting DB-files from different versions of SpatiaLite
    - spatialite_dxf: an tool importing DXF files
    - OSM-tools: spatialite_osm_raw, spatialite_osm_filter, spatialite_osm_map, spatialite_osm_net, spatialite_osm_overpass: tools supporting OpenStreetMap datasets
    - XML-tools: spatialite_xml_load, spatialite_xml_collapse, spatialite_xml_print, spatialite_xml_validator, spatialite_xml2utf8: tools supporting XML files processing
